# !! NOTICE !!
this mod is a port of [Moffein](https://github.com/Moffein)'s mod for SotS. I've made this with permission.
![Permission](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodzpod/BanditDynamite/master/perm.png)

also ignore what the other guy says Bandit Tweaks is dead see [RiskyTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Risky_Lives/RiskyTweaks/) and [AssistManager](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/AssistManager/) instead (they are the updated version)

Adds Bandit's classic Dynamite Toss from RoR1 as an alt skill.

Stats are the same as BanditReloaded's Dynamite by default, but can be changed in the config.
All players need the mod.

I recommend also checking out Bandit Tweaks (https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/Bandit_Tweaks/)
